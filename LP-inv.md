# Liquidity Pool Investment

## How does a Liquidity Pool work?

Providing a trustless smart contract, which always holds an equal value in both assets. 

Adding funds to the pool, creates new pool-tokens. Those pool-tokens can later be used to withdraw funds again. 

The pool-token holder earns the pool-taker and pool-withdraw fee.

## How much does a Liquidity Pool earn?

The total earning is highly dependent on:
- Fixed taker fee 
- Taker volume
- Withdraw fee
- Withdraw volume
- Extra payout by project

## Can I only add one asset to the Liquidity Pool ?

No, both assets are needed for deposit. 

## How save is investing in a Liquidity Pool ?

As save, as the assets in the pool. When one asset of the pool reaches zero value, the poolen token does the same.

- Asset quality

- Extra payout
- Pool size
