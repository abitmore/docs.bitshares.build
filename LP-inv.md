# Liquidity Pool Investment

## How does a Liquidity Pool work?

Providing a trustless smart contract, which always holds an equal amount of both assets. 

Adding funds to the pool, creates new pool-tokens. Those pool-tokens can later be used to withdraw funds again.

##  How can I combine a Liquidity Pool with a Market Pegged Asset (MPA) ?

Liquidity Pools, which use a MPA/Collateral pair, can be used to stake a long, neutral or short position.
